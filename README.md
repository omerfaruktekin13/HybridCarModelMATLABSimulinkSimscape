## Description
I made Hybrid car modeling using MATLAB Simulink Simscape and Powertrain Blockset. The first picture is the engine part of the vehicle, the second picture is the battery design and Mapped engine, the third picture is the transmission, the fourth picture is the differentials, the 5th picture is the brake and wheel physics, the 6th picture is the design of the environmental features of the vehicle and the road it travels. In the battery design, I chose the lithium-ion variant battery. As seen in the 7th picture, I tested and optimized some features of the engine thanks to the Model Based Calibration Toolbox. I re-imported the results to the Simulink model. To avoid ambiguity, I've included a description of some of the GoTo-From block names I use in the documentation.

## Installation
> 1. Download SDF_to_ParaView.cpp file
> 2. You will see mathematics operations for the calculation of every primitive shape's distance from its surface to the blank point cloud border.
> 3. After the calculation of the chosen shape, you will get arrays full of float numbers.
> 4. You can transfer this result as a table to Paraview and implement some filters to visualize your results.
> 5. Don't forget to edit your Color Map to effective analyzes.
